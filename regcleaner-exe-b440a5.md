RegCleaner.exe is an executable file associated with Autodesk DWF Viewer, a software product developed by Autodesk, Inc., specifically version 7.0.0.928. While it is not inherently a virus or malware, users should exercise caution, as its legitimate function relates to the management and cleaning of the Windows registry, which can be beneficial in resolving errors and improving system performance. However, improper use of registry cleaning tools can lead to unintended consequences, such as system instability or loss of essential data, so it is crucial to ensure that this application is used correctly and only if the user understands the risks involved. Additionally, given the prevalence of malware disguising itself with familiar filenames, it is advisable for users to verify the authenticity of the software and ensure it is downloaded from a reputable source to avoid potential security risks.
